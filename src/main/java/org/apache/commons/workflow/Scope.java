/**
 * <p>A <strong>Scope</strong> is a collection of arbitrary Java objects,
 * keyed by String-valued names.  Specialized workflow implementations
 * will register their own <code>Scope</code> implementations to connect
 * the workflow engine processing to their own execution environments.
 * For example, a web layer implementation would most likely adapt
 * Scopes to the request attributes, session attributes, and servlet
 * context attributes provided by the Servlet API.</p>
 *
 * <p>A Scope implements the API contracts of <code>java.util.Map</code>
 * with the following additional rules:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Keys must be of the <code>java.lang.String</code></li>
 * <li>Null keys are not allowed</li>
 * <li>Null beans are not allowed</li>
 * </ul>
