<p>Implementations of <code>Steps</code> in the <em>io</em> library.</p>

<div align="center">
<h2>I/O Step Library - Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>This package contains
<a href="../Step.html">org.apache.commons.workflow.Step</a> implementations
for the <em>io</em> library.  This library includes Steps for importing
information from (or exporting information to) external locations.</p>

<p>The sections below define each of the Step definitions included in this
library, utilizing the XML syntax that is recognized by the Digester used to
process your Activity definition files.  Although you can use any namespace
prefix, the convention is to declare <code>io</code> as the namespace prefix,
as in the following example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;base:activity id="Demonstration Activity"
    xmlns:base="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/workflow/base"
    xmlns:core="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/workflow/core"
    xmlns:io="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/workflow/io"
  &gt;

    &lt;io:write file="topitem.txt"/&gt;

  &lt;/base:activity&gt;
</pre>

<p><em>NOTE</em> - It is <strong>not</strong> required that you use the XML
syntax, processed with a Digester, to initialize the Steps associated with
each Activity.  However, this usage is very convenient, and is likely to be
the most common case, so the Steps are documented from that perspective.  To
use the underlying implementation classes directly, see the Javadocs for each
Step implementation class, just as you would for any other Java class.</p>

<h2>I/O Step Library - Step Definitions</h2>
</div>

<a name="io:display"></a>
<h3>io:display</h3>

<p>The <em>io:display</em> Step evaluates the properties specified by
all nested <code>&lt;io:descriptor&gt;</code> elements, converts them to
String (if necessary), and prints them to Java's standard output.</p>

<p>The <em>io:display</em> element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong> - Optional identifier of this Step, which can be used
    as the destination for control transfers.  If specified, must be unique
    within the current Activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may nest any number of <a href="#io:descriptor">io:descriptor</a>
elements within a <em>io:display</em> element.  All of them will be evaluated
and displayed in order specified.</p>

<p>In the following example, the "address" and "customer" beans will
be converted to Strings (by calling their <code>toString()</code> methods)
and the results displayed to standard output.</p>
<pre>
  <strong>&lt;io:display &gt;</strong>
    &lt;io:descriptor xpath="address"/&gt;
    &lt;io:descriptor xpath="customer"/&gt;
  <strong>&lt;/io:display&gt;</strong>
</pre>


<a name="io:get"></a>
<h3>io:get</h3>

<p>The <em>io:get</em> Step connects to a specified URL, retrieves the
corresponding value as a String, and pushes the result on to the evaluation
stack.</p>

<p>The <em>io:get</em> element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong> - Optional identifier of this Step, which can be used
    as the destination for control transfers.  If specified, must be unique
    within the current Activity.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - URL of the resource to be retrieved.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following example, the home page of a local web server is
retrieved and pushed on to the evaluation stack as a String:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>&lt;io:get url="http://localhost:8080/index.html"/&gt;</strong>
</pre>


<a name="io:peek"></a>
<h3>io:peek</h3>

<p>The <em>io:peek</em> Step makes a copy of the top item on the
evaluation stack, converts it to a String (if necesary), and prints it to
standard output.  This is useful for debugging, and is shorthand for
the following:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;core:duplicate/&gt;
  &lt;io:display&gt;
    &lt;io:descriptor/&gt;
  &lt;/io:display&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <em>io:peek</em> element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong> - Optional identifier of this Step, which can be used
    as the destination for control transfers.  If specified, must be unique
    within the current Activity.</li>
</ul>


<a name="io:read"></a>
<h3>io:read</h3>

<p>The <em>io:read</em> Step reads the characters of the specified file,
converts them to a String, and pushes this String on to the evaluation stack.
</p>

<p>The <em>io:read</em> element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>encoding</strong> - Character encoding to use when reading
    this file.  If not specified, the platform default encoding will be used.</li>
<li><strong>file</strong> - Relative or absolute pathname of the file to
    be read by this Step.</li>
<li><strong>id</strong> - Optional identifier of this Step, which can be used
    as the destination for control transfers.  If specified, must be unique
    within the current Activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, the contents of the specified file are read,
converted to a String, and pushed on to the evaluation stack:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>&lt;io:read file="data.txt"/&gt;</strong>
</pre>


<a name="io:write"></a>
<h3>io:write</h3>

<p>The <em>io:write</em> Step pops the top item from the evaluation
stack, converts it to a String (if necessary), and writes the characters
to the specified file.</p>

<p>The <em>io:write</em> element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>encoding</strong> - Character encoding to use when writing
    this file.  If not specified, the platform default encoding will be used.</li>
<li><strong>file</strong> - Relative or absolute pathname of the file to
    be written by this Step.</li>
<li><strong>id</strong> - Optional identifier of this Step, which can be used
    as the destination for control transfers.  If specified, must be unique
    within the current Activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, the contents of the specified file are written
based on the contents of the popped evaluation stack element:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>&lt;io:write file="data.txt"/&gt;</strong>
</pre>

<h2>I/O Step Library - Nested Elements</h2>
</div>

<a name="io:descriptor"></a>
<h3>io:descriptor</h3>

<p>An <em>io:descriptor</em> element is a description of the mechanism
by which an arbitrary Java object (typically a JavaBean) in some Scope, is
referenced.  This element recognizes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - The name under which this bean is stored,
    optionally located in the Scope specified by the <code>scope</code>
    attribute.</li>
<li><strong>scope</strong> - The name of the Scope within which to
    search for the bean named by the <code>name</code> attribute.  If
    not specified, the corresponding bean will be searched for in all Scopes,
    in ascending numeric order.</li>
<li><strong>type</strong> - Fully qualified Java class name that is expected
    (or set) via this descriptor.  If not specified, the actual Java class of the
    corresponding bean will be used.  This is useful, for example, when
    specifying the arguments to a <a href="#io:invoke">io:invoke</a>
    Step, and the invoked method expects a Java interface that is implemented
    by the actual object being passed as a parameter.</li>
<li><strong>xpath</strong> - An alternative method (to the <code>name</code>
    and <code>scope</code> attributes) for specifying the bean instance to be
    accessed by this descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax for XPath expressions is a sequence of one or more
identifier strings, separated by forward slash ("/") characters.  The expression
is evaluated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no slashes are present, the expression is assumed to be the name
    of an object that is stored in the "local" scope.</li>
<li>If one slash is present, the value before the slash is assumed to be the
    name of the scope in which to locate the bean, while the value after the
    slash is the name under which the bean is stored in that scope.  For
    example, the WebContext implementation of Context (commonly used
    when implementing Workflow in a servlet based environment), the scope
    names "request", "session", and "application" correspond to the
    request attributes, session attributes, and servlet context attributes
    provided by the underlying servlet container.</li>
<li>If more than one slash is present, the value before the first slash
    is interpreted as a scope name, as above.  The remainder of the
    expression accessed nested properties of beans, according to the
    syntax specified by the Commons JXPath package.</li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding what bean a particular descriptor applies to, the following
rules are applied, in this priority order:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <em>xpath</em> attribute is set, it is used as an
    XPath expression identifying the requested object.</li>
<li>If the <em>name</em> (and optional <em>scope</em>) attributes are
    specified, they are used to select a particular named bean,
    optionally found in a particular named scope.</li>
<li>If none of the conditions above are satisfied, the top object on the
    evaluation stack of our current <code>Context</code> is popped off the
    stack and consumed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FIXME</strong> - Support the <code>property</code> attribute
for access to bean properties via the Commons Beanutils package.</p>
